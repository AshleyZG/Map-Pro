# Map-Pro
To support programming instructors monitoring students' coding progress in in-class exercises, we designed this system to visualize the progress in real-time.   
The system includes a front-end interface and a backend interface. To launch the system, you need to start both the front-end and backend interfaces. 

# Frontend Interface
```shell
cd demo
npm start
```

# Backend Interface
```shell
cd backend
python server.py
```
